# OBAKit

<img src="WebResources/OBAKit-Logo-Web.png" alt="OBAKit">

OBAKit is a total rewrite of OneBusAway for iOS in the Swift programming language.

## Purpose and Goals

* This codebase is built as a set of reusable frameworks, which can be used to make new apps or augment existing apps on a wide variety of platforms.
* This codebase is meant to provide an easy way for transit agencies to create their own custom-branded transit apps without needing to fork the OneBusAway source code.
* This codebase is intended to be easy to understand, test, and maintain. We try to emphasize clarity over cleverness, even at the risk of being somewhat more verbose at times.
## Quick Start

To get started, you will need the following pieces of software installed on your computer:

1. [Xcode 12.x](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - Once installed, please launch Xcode and install any ancillary pieces of software about which it may prompt you.
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - A package manager used to install Xcodegen.
1. [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) - This is used to generate the `xcodeproj` file used to build the project.
1. [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) - _This should already be installed on your Mac_. A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
1. [RVM](https://rvm.io) - _Optional, but very helpful_. RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple Ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

Once you have these pieces of software installed, clone the OneBusAway app repository on GitHub. (After this rewrite becomes the official version of the app, it will be in the OneBusAway GitHub repository; for now ask Aaron for an invitation.)

    # Make sure you have Xcode 12.x and Homebrew installed.
    xcode-select --install
    brew install xcodegen
    brew install swiftlint
    # open the directory with the app code
    cd OBAKit
    # note: depending on your system configuration, you may need to run this command with sudo, i.e. sudo gem install bundler
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    scripts/generate_project OneBusAway
    open OBAKit.xcodeproj

## Project Files (.xcodeproj)

The directions above include a command `scripts/generate_project OneBusAway` to create the `xcodeproj` project file.  If you just want to build the OneBusAway app, that's all you need.  Here is some additional information in case you want to generate a different app.

OBAKit uses [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to create the `xcodeproj` file that makes Xcode function. XcodeGen takes a simple YAML file (`project.yml`) and turns it into a full-fledged `xcodeproj`. This makes it much easier to support white-labeling and managing multiple project targets.

Call `scripts/generate_project` from the project root directory with the name of a directory in `Apps`. So to generate the OneBusAway app, you run the command:

```bash
scripts/generate_project OneBusAway
```

Run `scripts/generate_project` on its own to see a list of available app targets.

## White Label Support

To create your own app target, duplicate the `Apps/OneBusAway` directory and update all of the available variables with the ones that are relevant to your project. [Learn more about White Label support by reading the documentation on the subject](Tutorials/WhiteLabel.md).

## Sub-Projects

The app, whether it is OneBusAway, KiedyBus, YRTViva, or another, is just a thin shell on top of two frameworks: `OBAKitCore` and `OBAKit`.

`OBAKitCore` is responsible for networking, data models and storage, location services, and region management.

`OBAKit` provides an iOS-compatible user interface that can easily be created from any app that consumes `OBAKit`.

`TodayView`, if your project supports it, is a widget that provides the user with easy access to a subset of their bookmarked transit routes from the [Today View](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-iphb8f1bf206/ios).

## Internationalization and Localization

_Note: There's a lot more to be written on this topic. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is wrong or confusing._

We are using Transifex to localize OneBusAway. You can help out by visiting [the OBA page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/open-transit-software-foundation/onebusaway-ios/).

Install the Transifex command line client (`tx`) by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client

For help configuring your Python environment on macOS, look here: https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac

Use `tx` by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction

Get an API token to use with `tx` by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/account/authentication

Fetch updated strings from Transifex by running the command `scripts/tx_pull`.

`tx_pull` extracts the full list of localizations that are specified in `app_shared.yml`, and requests the latest list of strings for each language from Transifex by calling `tx pull -l {LANG CODE}` under the hood.

## Objective-C Compatibility

OBAKit is written almost entirely in Swift, with the exception of a few small, ancillary pieces of code. This project is designed to be usable within both Swift and Objective-C projects. Please open an issue for scenarios encountered where you are unable to effectively use the framework generated by this project in Objective-C code.

## Documentation

This project uses [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/) and [Sourcekitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) to generate its documentation. To rebuild documentation, you will first need to have both projects installed:

```bash
bundle install
brew install sourcekitten
```

Once you have the necessary tools installed, you can regenerate documentation by running the command:

```bash
scripts/docs
```

Configuration data for the Jazzy-generated documentation can be found in the file `.jazzy.json` in the root of the repository.

## How-To's

### Protobuf

To make modifications to the local copy of `gtfs-realtime.proto`, you will need to install some new tools via the `brew` command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
brew install swift-protobuf
```

Now, replace the file `OBAKitCore/Models/Protobuf/gtfs-realtime.proto` with the updated version, and run `scripts/proto-gen.sh` from the project root.

You can find the latest version of the GTFS-RT protobuf file in the https://github.com/google/transit/ repository.
